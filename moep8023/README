./moep8023 -h gives help


Updates v1.1:
=============
- Added new command line option -l <1|2> that indicates whether you are going to
  pass layer 2 frames including link-layer header or IP packets including
IP-header but without link-layer header to moep8023. If the option is not set,
the former case is assumed. If -l3 is set, moep8023 will automatically create a
suitable link-layer header based on the next-hop address for the IP destination
given in the packet.  Note that frames passed from moep8023 to the domain socket
*always* include the link-layer header. You need it to identify the type of the
frame's payload (ARP, IP, ICMP, etc.).

- moep8023 will now automatically filter frames if their source MAC address
  matches the one of the Ethernet device specified at startup. This does not
change the behavior compared to v1.0 but was neccessary to avoid packet storms
when injecting IP-packets without link-layer header.


Previous updates:
=================
- Also catching SIGTERM to gracefully shutdown, i.e., removing the domain
  socket file descriptor.

- Fixed a bug that could lead to a segmentation fault when calling accept()
  due to uninitialized structs. Ubuntu-based systems seemed to be affected
  when compiler optimizations were turned on.
